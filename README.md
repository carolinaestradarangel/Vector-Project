# Vector-Project
This project was based on Vectors and being able to understanding vectors using OOP, and accepting only vectors in the program, otherwise it would give an error to the user. 
The project was able to output the dimension, item, equation, addition, and multiplication of vectors, and the overall challenge was to use specifically OOP to successfully understand what OOP did.
